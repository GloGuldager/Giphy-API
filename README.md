# Giphy-API
* Welcome to my Giphy Project. I chose eight of my favorite things to feature and invite you to add your own!
* This project highlighted the use of an AJAX call to an API to obtain data from an online/outside source. In this case we placed an AJAX call to Giphy.com to obtain giphy images that met a certain search criteria, i.e. various topics. It also featured the ability to pull only data that met other criteria such as ratings and the number of images per click event.
* An additional feature is the ability to make the images "animate" on click and return to "still" when clicked again.
* I struggled with the layout of the images, trying to get them to write to the DOM in an organized and pleasing way using flexbox CSS. It's not bad, but will work on this functionality more in the future.
* To view the images, click on one of the buttons, or add one of your own.
